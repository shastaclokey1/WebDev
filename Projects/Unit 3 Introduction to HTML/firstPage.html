		<p>There once was a dinosaur named <strong>Imbaka</strong>. He roamed the green hills of pangia until, one day, the fire nation attacked. Dragons flew threw the sky and terrorized Imbaka's colony of pterodactyls. The hunted fled and hid beneath lemon trees and bee hives thinking the dragons would never chase them into their den gaurded by thorns and stingers. Imbaka was wrong... The dragons rose high above thier prey and rained blazing tendrals of flame down upon the grounded pterodactyls. As the flames engulfed the colony, singing their bird-like flesh, meat mixed with the steaming lemon juices and boiling honey from the bees' hive. This, my friends, is the origin of <em>sweet and sour chicken</em>.</p>

		<p>I only kid. I have no Idea what genius created this Chinese dish.</p>
