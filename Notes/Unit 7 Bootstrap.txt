Bootstrap Bitches!

Objectives: (1) Be able to define bootstrap and explain how and why to use it.
	    (2) Learn to include bootstrap either locally or by using a CDN.
	    (3) Get used to using common bootstrap components like the nav bars and buttons.
	    (4) Get used to using the bootstrap grid system.

(1) - Bootstrap is an open source html/css collection that allows you to make nice looking web
      pages verry fast by including different sections of the bootstrap codebase in your projects.
    - Bootstrap allows you to add nicely styled elements and even whole components like nav bars.
    - https://getbootstrap.com/
    - Bootstrap is most commonly used for the grid system, nav bars, and overall fluidity.
    
(2) - The bootstrap webpage has download links for the actual source files (css, js, etc...).
    - When using the source files, just add the desired files to the project directory and
      link to the bootstrap.css file in the html document.
    - When using bootstrap with CDN, search for the desired version on google and include the
      specified CDN link tag into the html document. This will link to a version of the 
      bootstrap source code hosted on the web.
    - To use the linked bootstrap.css style library, add class selectors to the html elements
      as specified in the bootstrap documentation.

(3) - Button sizes, styles, functions can be manipulated by adding bootstrap specified class
      selectors to either <button> or <a> html elements.
    - All you have to do to change the default colors of the bootstrap styled elements is
      link to a second css style sheet and specify the element you want to style by class or
      id or whatever, then provide new colors, fonts, margins, borders, etc.
    - All of these bootstrap components are fully detailed in the bootstrap docs. Use the 
      docs as a reference and look up components as you think of new things to add.
